R Programming
=============
**R Programming** is the second course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

We will learn to program in R and use R for effective data analysis. This includes learning
to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment and
describe generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level
statistical language.

The course covers practical issues in stastical computing, which includes:
* programming in R
* reading data into R
* accessing R packages
* writing R functions
* debugging
* profiling R code
* organizing and commenting R code

Topics in statistical data analysis will provide working examples.
