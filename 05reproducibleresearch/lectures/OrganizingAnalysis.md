Organizing a Data Analysis
==========================
Here are some basics on organizing data analyses. While there is no universal standard, here are some useful tips to help allow the research to be reproducible.

Data Analysis Files
-------------------
* Data
 * raw data (include URLs, descriptions, date accessed in README)
 * processed data (include processing script in README; it should be tidy)
* Figures
 * exploratory figures (not necessarily part of the final report)
 * final figures (usually a small subset of original figures)
* R code
 * raw/unused scripts (less commented, may have multiple versions)
 * final scripts (clearly commented, include processing details)
 * R Markdown files
* Text
 * README files (not necessary if using R Markdown)
 * text of analysis (contains title, introduction, methods, results, conclusions, references)
