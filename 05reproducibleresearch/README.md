Reproducible Research
=====================
**Reproducible Research** is the fifth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

We will focus on concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a writen summary. Furthermore, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code used in the analysis are available.

We will focus on literate statistical analysis tools to publish data analyses in a single document, allowing others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results. We will learn to write these documents using R markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program, compile R markdown documents using **{knitr}** and related tools, and organize a data analysis so that it is reproducible and accessible to others.
