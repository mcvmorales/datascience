Variance
========
The **variance** of a random variable is a measure of *spread*. Densities with higher variances are more spread out, whereas densities with lower variances are less spread out.

The square root of the variance is called the **standard deviation**.  

The ** sample variance** is exactly a function of data. It has an associate population distribution. Its expected value is the population variance.
