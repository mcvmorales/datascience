Distributions
=============
The **Bernoulli distribution** arises as the result of a binary outcome. Bernoulli random variables take only the values 1 and 0 with probabilities of (for example) *p* and 1 - *p* respectively.  
* The mean of a Bernoulli random variable is *p*
* The variance is *p*(1 - *p*)
