Expected Values
===============
In statistical inference, we also look at the characteristics of probability mass and probability density functions and, as a result, characteristics of the random variables from which these functions are drawn. The most useful characterization is called the **expected value** (quantiles is another important characterization).

The expected value or **mean** is a characterization of a function's center. It is the center of its distribution.  
The **variance** and **standard deviation** are characterizations of how spread out a function is.  
The **empirical mean** is the center of mass of the data.

Some Facts
----------
* Expected values are properties of distributions.
* The average of random variables is itself a random variable and is associated distribution has an expected value.
* The **population mean** is the center of mass of population.
* The **sample mean** is the center of mass of the observed data.
* The **sample mean** is an estimate of the **population mean**.
* The sample mean is unbiased.
* The more data that goes into the sample mean, the more concentrate its density / mass function is around the population mean.
