Statistical Inference
=====================
**Statistical Inference** is the sixth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. Techniques include statistical modeling, data-oriented strategies, and the explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses.

We will learn the fundamentals of statistical inference. There will be a broad overview of the goals, assumptions, and modes of performing statistical inference. We will perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and will be able to use the skills deveoped as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.
